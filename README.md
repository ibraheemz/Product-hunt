# Product Hunt Clone

Welcome to the Product Hunt Clone web application! This is a React-based clone of the famous ProductHunt web application, built with guidance from a senior software engineer mentor.

## Description

This project is an implementation of the Product Hunt web application, with features such as integrating with ProductHunt's REST APIs, implementing a responsive UI that matches the app's design, and contributing to writing specifications and user stories of product features.

The project was implemented from A to Z with mentoring in code reviewing, structure, used design patterns, and following best practices. We used the project management tool Trello to organize tasks and Git as a version control tool from day one.

This project is built using:

- ReactJS
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- HTTP
- REST Architecture
- Git
- Responsive UI
- Asynchronous HTTP Requests
